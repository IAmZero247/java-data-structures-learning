java-data-structures
====================

Practice implementations of some common data structures and algorithms in java.

B-Tree
---------------
Aims:
* reinvent the wheel (for the fun of it)
* &#10004; null not used at all (used Guava Optional)
* 100% unit test coverage
* &#10004; add
* &#10004;  iterate
* &#10004; find
* delete
* &#10004; thread-safe with minimal locking
* &#10004; persist to disk and load from disk efficiently
* &#10004; use log structure storage (LSS)
* use multiple files for LSS
* recover unused LSS storage
* &#10004; append only batched writes
* &#10004; enable snapshots/transactions
* &#10004; tuneable memory use (can use disk when required)

General programming aims not specific to this project
------------------------------------------------------
Code should be
* Elegant
* Concise
* Readable

Coder should
* Leverage symmetry
* Favour immutability
* Minimize overlap of unit tests
* Maximize coverage of unit tests

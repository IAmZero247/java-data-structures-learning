Practice implementations of some common data structures and algorithms in java.

B-Tree
---------------
Aims:
* use generics
* null not used at all (used Guava Optional)
* 100% unit test coverage
* thread-safe with minimal locking
* persist to disk and load from disk efficiently
* minimal memory use (uses disk when required)

Status: in progress

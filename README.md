java-data-structures
====================

Practice implementations of some common data structures and algorithms in java.

B-Tree
---------------
Aims:
* reinvent the wheel (for the fun of it)
* null not used at all (used Guava Optional)
* 100% unit test coverage
* thread-safe with minimal locking
* persist to disk and load from disk efficiently
* use log structure storage (LSS)
* enable snapshots
* tuneable memory use (can use disk when required)

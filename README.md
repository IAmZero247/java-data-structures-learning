java-data-structures
====================

Practice implementations of some common data structures and algorithms in java.

B-Tree
---------------
Aims:
* reinvent the wheel (for the fun of it)
* null not used at all (used Guava Optional) &#10004;
* 100% unit test coverage
* add &#10004;
* iterate &#10004;
* find &#10004;
* delete
* thread-safe with minimal locking &#10004;
* persist to disk and load from disk efficiently &#10004;
* use log structure storage (LSS) &#10004;
* use multiple files for LSS
* recover unused LSS storage
* append only batched writes &#10004;
* enable snapshots &#10004;
* tuneable memory use (can use disk when required) &#10004;

General programming aims not specific to this project
------------------------------------------------------
Code should be
* Elegant
* Concise
* Readable

Coder should
* Leverage symmetry
* Favour immutability
* Minimize overlap of unit tests
* Maximize coverage of unit tests
